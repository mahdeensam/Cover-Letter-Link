            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

            <p>I hope you are doing great! Through my letter, I am conveying my deep interest in the Private Equity Analyst position at Ironwood Capital. With that in mind, I am eager to introduce myself first as a Computer Science and Economics major at Colby College and tell you how passionate I am about finance and data science. Throughout my college years, I dedicated myself for the expertise I gained and am excited about the opportunity to showcase to Ironwood's mission of providing non-control growth capital to lower middle-market companies — and trust me, you will get excited too if you know me more, and for that, I want the opportunity to connect and prove myself. In addition, I truly understand your commitment to creating value through operational improvements and flexible capital solutions, and it really echoes with my career aspirations. I am confident that with a little guidance, I can bring meaningful value to the company.</p>

            <p>As outlined in my resume, during my internship at FoW Partners L.P. (previously Two Sigma Impact), I had the opportunity to design and deploy modern time-series models like ARIMA, Ratio-Modeling, and Prophet, along with financial forecasting frameworks for portfolio companies. That work required using machine learning in Python, SQL, and Tableau. It wasn't just intellectually stimulating—it was truly fulfilling to see the real-world impact of our work. Just imagine, opening a dashboard and seeing how all portfolio companies are doing. I still remember the rush of excitement when I presented my first comprehensive financial evaluation to the Director Manager. That moment? It totally solidified my passion for financial analysis!</p>

            <p>In addition to working with time-series models, I was gaining insights from the deal team about how the financial modeling tradition operated at my previous company. Using Python and Excel, I projected future revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital changes to estimate free cash flows (FCF) over a set forecast period. Additionally, I was trained to structure an LBO transaction by forecasting the company’s financials under various financing structures (debt, equity, etc.). By determining the amount of debt financing the company could sustain, I acquired proficiency in modeling the cash flows used for debt repayments over time, ensuring the company remained solvent while repaying debt. In recognition of my work, I collaborated with my supervisor, an operating principal, to deliver weekly financial updates to the entire team during Monday meetings.</p>

            <p>Having all these experiences, what really draws me to Ironwood Capital, beyond its impressive track record (which is remarkable, by the way), is the company’s focus on building long-term relationships with portfolio companies—something I learned from Colby College culture and my conversations with Alex, Jacqueline, and Sarah. This philosophy aligns perfectly with my belief that sustainable growth comes from genuine partnerships and strategic support. Honestly, I’m extremely eager to contribute to this philosophy and learn from your experienced team.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my letter. I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills, experiences, and passion for value creation can contribute to Ironwood Capital's continued success. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview. Please find the link to my cover letter here. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Mahdeen (Sameer) Khan</p>
